## PoPConn.py usage

Implementation of the image

![InternalConsensus](https://github.com/andy897221/Proof-of-Play/blob/master/resources/img/rating.png "P2P")

Updates on the finalized library usage soon

## Problem

py2p is buggy, there is no safe disconnect for a single node, so for Internal Consensus, no disconnecting features

py2p is not used for blockchain codes
