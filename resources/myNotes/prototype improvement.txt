Improvement
- sign new block everytime writing (using own pri key)
- a dictionary with key: pub key, val: ip addr for identify blockchains
- moving average for rating
- a block id
- a match id (use file name? need re-gen genesis match with id)
- a mechanism to add remaining matches not processed by others node as current matches if new block is by others node
- verify chain by sign too

Demo
- a match generator generating other pub keys with specified winner and specified rating val
- a way to show current status of the blockchain with clear UI of match data
- keep inputting stream of matches by a 50 blockchains simulation, check forks afterwards (need a controller script to check all blockchains)
