I need to broadcast disconnect msg because some node didnt del the node in the routing_table?

Yes, apparently, for disconnect function, it disconnect the entire routing_table of the connecting node (bootstrap), so need to self write disconnect function

- Disconnecting Node (DC) broadcast disconnect msg, all other nodes del its id, DC sys exit, done

what is await asyncio sleep actual usage?


P1,  P2,  P3,  P4  each  ask  for  a  signature  from  the  ownerof  the  hash  to  confirm  the  hash,  after  they  received  thebroadcasted hash from the other players
player can still change the hash after people confirmed, confirm the intention of this operation

-- can directly send signed hash, then ask each other to confirm if the hash is correct, then sin start the step of revealing results
